              <img src="images/experience/m-keyvalue.jpg" class="experience-img" alt="Microsoft Internship">
              <p class="experience-summary"> Developed an in memory key-value store (Distributed Systems course project) with features like Detection of Strict Consistency
                or Eventually consistent and Support for Consistency levels. Last fall I was a software engineering intern at Facebook in Menlo Park.
              There, I worked on the Support Interfaces team under the Protect and Care org. I implemented a new
              Support Inbox item type that notifies victims of tag spam that the content they were tagged in was
              taken down by Facebook for spam. With this new feature, victims are now aware of the efforts that
              Facebook takes to make the platform more spam-free. By informing more people that action was taken
              against spam, this will hopefully encourage more spam reporting behavior. This was done with a little
              help from Hack (Facebook's PHP language), Haskell, SQL, and Thrift.</p>
