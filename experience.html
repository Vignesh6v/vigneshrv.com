              <p class="experience-summary"> Last summer I was a software engineering intern at Radiator Labs in New York.
                I had the chance to work on the dashboard application under the Full Stack team.
                I was the primary developer for data monitoring dashboard and Operational Management App.
                With this new feature, we can pull and analyze real-time data to see statistics and energy usage information. Also after vigorous homework and analysis,
                we designed a better visualization data model, which will hopefully encourage optimal usage behavior of the steam radiator. </p>
